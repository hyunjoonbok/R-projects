# R Portfolio
R Portfolio of data science projects from either original work or revised for a study and learning purpose. Portfolio in this repo is presented in the form of .R and .Rmd(R-markdown) files.

For a curated list of more visually-pleasant portfolio with graphs, check out [My Portfolio Website](https://hyunjoonbok.github.io/)

For a detailed code example and images, please refer to readme file in each folder under framework names (*Work-In-Progress*).

*Note: Data used in the projects is for learning and demo purposes only*

## Motivation / Thought Process
As R is often less preferrable compared to other languages in terms of less production-ready codes, I think R is still a very powerful language. I personally am fond of and use R for everyday analysis from simple EDA to creating stunning visualizations and building a complex ML/DL models. I think R has its strong advantage in looking at codes and results at a controlled enviornmenets.  

This repository was origianlly to have a record of project progress and my own learning process, but I found that it would be helpful to who wants to improve data-science skills to next-level using R language, as it contains a numerious real-life data science example and notebooks created by [@hyunjoonbok](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyunjoonbok/) and codes borrowed from authors who produced state-of-the-art results.

I tried to include the usage of packages and methods that have been consistently used in actual industries, in order to to solve the problems (even if it's a toy example). The repo contatins use-cases that can be readily applied to many of real-world datasets.

## Projects

- ## Machine Learning
   ### [Titanic Survival ML Algorithm](https://github.com/hyunjoonbok/R-projects/blob/master/Machine-Learning/First%20ML%20algorithm.Rmd): 
   <p>
   The famous Titanic ML problem tackeld using R. Touches complete steps neccesary for ML modeling process (data-loading, data-cleaning, EDA, featureing engineering, ML modeling, Cross Validation, Scoring, and Next steps).

   ### [Time Series ML using H2O](https://github.com/hyunjoonbok/R-projects/blob/master/Machine-Learning/H2O%20for%20Machine%20Learning.R): 
   <p>
   Predicting a future beer sale number using a historical data. Using H20's AUTOML feature to easily obtint the state-of-the-art ensemble results, and plot the errors to improve.
